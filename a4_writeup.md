# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
makeing the algorithim to see if the player has won, i had to look up how to use sets and how subsets worked

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would make it play the center as a second move or a corner for its first, then i could make it evaluatate what move would block to most wins by seeing what number is in the most remaning lists thouh trouble will occur when multiple of the same amount are in the lists.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

like i said before make it play a corner first or center second, this guerntess a win or a draw. i can code it to make moves reacting on how the player moves.
